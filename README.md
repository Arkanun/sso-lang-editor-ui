# sso-lang-editor-ui

**sso-lang-editor-ui** is an Open Source editor to handle Saint Seiya Online translation files. It supports most versions of `lang_data.data` and currently only available for Windows.

It uses SQLite3 for indexing translation folders and elements resulting in an overwall performance when searching.
